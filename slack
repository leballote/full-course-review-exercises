This week I almost finished the feedback and reviewed Helam's code. I also helped Cesar and Jesus Carmona a bit.

The parts that took me some time were the react exercises which I had to almost rebuild from the ground since I was not using the requested technologies;

Now I am only left with parsing the tree which had only a couple of bugs, but I am asked to make it "not that complicated" and I am trying to figure out that. I should have it like in one hour or two tops, then I continue with the github pipeline.

NOTE: I still have one algorithm pending which I haven't unsterstood, I'll approach it again on Monday.
